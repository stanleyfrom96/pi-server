It means a lot to us.<br><br>We have thought carefully about how to approach the topic of the “server” in a way that goes beyond an extractivist perspective. Rather than seeing the server merely as a tool “for us,” we want to consider it as a shared space that requires nurturing.</p><p>When our group first tried to build a server, we found ourselves asking: What exactly is a server*? At that time, Asya gave us a simple yet clear answer: “The server is someone else’s computer.” In today’s meeting, we want to challenge the idea of accessing the server space by using the metaphor of a piece of land.</p><p>In this workshop “someone else’s computer” will be transformed into a collective garden, encouraging us to think aloud about what is shared, where it is, and how we can care for it.</p><p>By using this metaphor, we aim to avoid the constraints of programming language and make servers a more tangible space. Seeing the server as a garden also helps us raise questions about accessibility and needs.</p>"},"id":"80ae1ee4-111d-4169-94a4-39667cbe5903","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"How to access our server? ⁺₊⋆"},"id":"377a0a8a-602a-43f2-848a-9969e24d54ad","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>(description on how to) (github) etc</p>"},"id":"f2d2f9f9-942c-4962-8e50-d850a882c232","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}],"id":"798aa310-3b41-47d5-bd24-0bea73851991","width":"1/1"}],"id":"68f85ea6-51ac-4fe3-ac2b-6a365eb02b64"},{"attrs":{"class":"","id":""},"columns":[{"blocks":[{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"The Garden of Many Roots ❀ ⁺₊"},"id":"524acd8c-8d41-4816-b751-849f8fecb4c7","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>✿ <strong>The Fruit Without Seeds</strong></p><p>Pip the squirrel was known for being quick, clever, and just a little bit lazy. He loved shortcuts and never saw the point in hard work when there was an easier way. His favorite thing to do was visit the silver towers of the big market at the edge of the forest. The towers hummed softly, their shiny surfaces gleaming like the sun. Inside, fruit of every kind sat in neat, colorful rows, ready to be picked up without so much as a climb.</p><p>One morning, Pip sat under a tree eating a shiny red apple he had bought at the market. The apple was sweet and juicy, but something about it felt... odd. It was perfect, too perfect, and when Pip finished, there were no seeds left inside. Just an empty core.</p><p>“Strange,” Pip muttered, tossing the core away. But before he could think much about it, he spotted a flash of red fur in the distance. A fox was digging furiously in the dry, cracked soil near the clearing.</p><p>Curious, Pip scurried closer. “What are you doing?” he asked, peering over the fox’s shoulder.</p><p>“I’m planting a seed,” the fox said without looking up.</p><p>Pip tilted his head. “Why would you do that? The market has all the fruit you could ever need, and it’s much easier than digging in this dry dirt.”</p><p>The fox paused, brushing dust off his nose. “Have you ever wondered why the market fruit has no seeds?”</p><p>“No,” Pip said, shrugging. “Why does it matter?”</p><p>The fox pointed to the silver towers on the horizon. “The market grows its fruit in boxes—no trees, no roots, just quick and easy. But without seeds, there’s no future. And without roots, nothing remembers.”</p><p>Pip frowned. “What’s there to remember? It’s just fruit.”</p><p>The fox smiled knowingly. “Come back tomorrow,” he said. “I’ll show you.”<br></p>"},"id":"1fd7342c-7509-462f-873f-bfad445a4f50","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":[],"id":"4ebe65a8-6847-464a-b837-5cc08fe1b3d4","isHidden":false,"type":"line"},{"content":{"text":"<p>✿ <strong>The First Seed</strong></p><p>The next day, Pip found himself back at the clearing, watching as the fox carefully placed a tiny seed into the ground. The soil was cracked and dry, and Pip couldn’t imagine anything growing there.</p><p>“This will never work,” Pip said, crossing his arms. “The market is faster and easier.”</p><p>The fox didn’t answer. Instead, he showed Pip how to cover the seed with soil, patting it gently, and how to pour just enough water to wake it up. “It takes patience,” the fox said. “The soil needs time to remember.”</p><p>“Remember what?” Pip asked.</p><p>“That something cared enough to plant a seed,” the fox replied.</p><p>Days passed, and Pip grew frustrated. Every morning, he came to the clearing to find the same patch of dirt. “Nothing’s happening,” he grumbled.</p><p>The fox just smiled. “Keep tending it.”</p><p>Then one morning, Pip saw it—a tiny green sprout pushing through the soil. He gasped. “It’s alive!”</p><p>“Of course it is,” said the fox. “The soil remembers.”</p>"},"id":"c90aef4e-7e12-41aa-ae98-8c3b3e10312f","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":[],"id":"267e7637-d86c-407d-9dc0-d3bb93f820dd","isHidden":false,"type":"line"},{"content":{"text":"<p>✿ <strong>The Questions Beneath the Soil</strong></p><p>Other animals began to arrive.&nbsp;</p><p>The first was a mole, who dug tunnels beneath the garden. “The roots need space to stretch,” she said, her claws caked with dirt. “Think of it like making paths for wires under the ground.”</p><p>Next came a sparrow, carrying a seed in her beak. She dropped it gently into the soil and flitted to a nearby branch. “More seeds mean stronger connections,” she chirped. “A single sprout can’t make a garden.”</p><p>As the days passed, they brought not only seeds and tools but also questions.</p><p>“Who decides what grows?” asked the owl, her feathers gleaming in the sunlight.<br>“Who will dig the deepest burrows?” asked the mole, wiping the dirt from his claws.<br>“How will we make sure no one takes more than their share?” asked the fox, his tail sweeping the ground behind him.</p><p>At first, the questions seemed to tangle like vines, pulling us in different directions. Voices overlapped, arguments flared, and for a moment, I wondered if the garden would fall apart.</p><p>But then something remarkable happened. The animals began to listen.</p><p>We gathered in small circles beneath the shade of the tallest plants, sharing our struggles and hopes. The owl proposed a set of rules, clear lines that would define who could plant and who could harvest. The fox argued for trust, insisting that a garden couldn’t thrive on restrictions alone. The sparrow suggested we look to the roots for guidance.</p><p>One evening, the fox stood up. He held a single fruit in his paws, its skin dappled with sunlight.</p><p>“This garden does not belong to any one of us,” he said. “It belongs to everyone who has cared for it, and everyone who will care for it in the future. But care is not something that can be divided equally, like berries on a plate. Sometimes, care is heaviest for those with the least to give. What we must decide is not how to avoid the weight of care, but how to share it.”</p><p>His words rippled through the group like wind through leaves. Some nodded, while others sat in silence, their faces thoughtful.</p><p>Later, the owl turned to me. “What do you think it means to share care?” she asked. “Can it ever be fair?”</p><p>I didn’t have an answer.</p>"},"id":"6f772c36-1f18-4835-8a7d-8c139799bc74","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":[],"id":"e780d5e0-bbd8-4ca8-ac07-de19305fc85a","isHidden":false,"type":"line"},{"content":{"text":"<p>✿ <strong>Listening to the Roots</strong></p><p>By the time the garden bloomed, it was transformed. Vines wove between sturdy stalks, herbs grew wild and fragrant, and blossoms opened their faces to the sun.

They stretched deep and wide, weaving together in a dense, intricate web.</p><p>“They talk to each other,” he said, his voice almost reverent. “They remember every storm, every pawprint, every claw that has tilled the soil. They hold it all, even when we forget.
